    <h1>Ice Cream</h1>
    <img src="iceCream.jpg" alt="iceCream">
    <p>This sweet cream ice cream is just like what you get at Cold Stone Creamery, Maggie Moo's, or Marble Slab Creamery — only better because it's homemade and a lot cheaper. It's great on its own, but you can also top it off with cookies, fruit, candy pieces, or whatever else you like. 
        You will need an ice cream maker for this.</p>
